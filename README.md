# hello-world
Hello everyone, My name is Kyle McEntee. This is my first CS class and I am excited to learn as much as possible. I initialy was a Business Major but switched over to Computer Science to establish a strong foundation in CS then applying the knowledge and experience gained to break into cybersecurity. I went back to school later in life after spending over 14 years in the military as an Intelligence Analyst and HR Specialist. I look forward to working with you all this semester!
